  Overview
This project is a Python-based Discord bot designed to enhance your Discord server's experience with custom commands, tasks, and persistent storage using SQLite. The bot is capable of handling multiple server interactions and provides features such as logging, task scheduling, and data visualization.

Features
Command Handling: The bot processes user inputs with the ! command prefix.
Database Support: Stores and retrieves data from an SQLite database (discord.db), making the bot stateful across restarts.
Logging: Tracks events and activities in a structured log file (app.log).
Task Scheduling: Schedules repeated tasks using the discord.ext.tasks extension.
Data Visualization: Uses matplotlib to create charts and graphs, which can be displayed or sent within Discord.
Concurrency: Manages asynchronous operations with asyncio for smooth interaction handling.
Extensible: Can easily add new commands and features.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before setting up the bot:

Python 3.8+
Pip (Python's package installer)
Discord account with a registered bot token (see Discord Developer Portal)
Installation
Clone the repository:
`git clone <repo-url>
`
Navigate to the project directory:
`cd <project-directory>
`
Install dependencies: Install the required Python libraries by running:
`pip install -r requirements.txt
`
Set up Discord Developer Application:

Go to the Discord Developer Portal and create a new application.
Generate your bot's token and add it to your environment.
Configuration
Before running the bot, you need to configure your Discord bot token:

Open main.py and locate the following line:
`bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
`
Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with the actual token from the Discord Developer Portal.
Alternatively, you can set the token as an environment variable:

`export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN='your-bot-token'
`
Database Setup
The bot uses SQLite for data persistence. The database (discord.db) is created automatically on the first run. If you need to customize the database structure:

Modify the SQL queries in the main.py file.
Run the bot to automatically initialize the new schema.
Example database connection:

`conn = sqlite3.connect('discord.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
# Your custom SQL queries go here
`
Usage
To start the bot, simply run:

`python main.py
`
Once the bot is running, you can interact with it through your Discord server using commands prefixed with !.

Example Commands:
!help: Shows a list of available commands.
!ping: Responds with "Pong!" to check if the bot is responsive.
Custom commands can be added by editing the main.py file.
Command List
Below are the default commands available:

!ping: Basic command to check bot responsiveness.
!time: Displays the current server time.
!add <num1> <num2>: Adds two numbers and returns the result.
!plot: Generates a sample plot using matplotlib and sends it in the chat.
You can extend the bot's command list by adding new @bot.command() functions in main.py.

Logging
All bot activities and errors are logged in the app.log file. You can modify the logging level by adjusting the logging.basicConfig() function:

`logging.basicConfig(
    filename='app.log',
    level=logging.INFO,  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
`
Error Handling
The bot includes basic error handling. For instance, if a user enters an incorrect command or input, the bot will log the error and respond with a helpful message.

Example error handler:

`@bot.event
async def on_command_error(ctx, error):
    if isinstance(error, commands.CommandNotFound):
        await ctx.send("Sorry, I don't understand that command.")
    else:
        await ctx.send("An error occurred.")
        logger.error(f"Error: {error}")
`
Customization
To extend the bot’s functionality, you can:

Add more commands by defining functions with @bot.command().
Modify the database schema in the SQLite setup.
Implement additional tasks using the @tasks.loop() decorator for periodic functions.
Here’s an example of adding a new command:

`@bot.command()
async def greet(ctx):
    await ctx.send("Hello! I'm your friendly bot.")
`
